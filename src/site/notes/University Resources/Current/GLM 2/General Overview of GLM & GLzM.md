| **_Definition_**      | Compares each level of the independent variable (IV) to a specific reference level (e.g., the first or last condition).                                                                  | Compares each level of independent variable to the previous level, analyzing changes step by step.                                                                | Tests for trends across conditions, identifying whether the pattern is linear, quadratic, cubic, etc.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **_Comparison Type_** | Each level is compared to a **_fixed_** reference level.                                                                                                                                 | Each level is compared **_only to the level immediately before it_**.                                                                                             | Examines **_overall patterns_** in the data rather than specific group comparisons.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **_Use_**             | Used when there is a **_control group_** / **_baseline_** condition, and other groups are compared to it.                                                                                | Used when testing for **_gradual changes_** over time, treatment stages, or progressive conditions.                                                               | Used when independent variable represents **_an ordered sequence_** (e.g., time points, increasing doses) and we want to test if the pattern follows a **_straight line_** or **_curve_**.                                                                                 |
| **_Example_**         | Compares **B** vs. **A**, **C** vs. **A**, and **D** vs. **A** (if A is the reference)<br><br>Alternatively, could compare **B** vs. **D**, **C** vs. **D**, etc. if D is the reference. | Compares **B** vs. **A**, **C** vs. **B**, and **D** vs. **C**.<br><br>Each contrast looks at **_differences between consecutive levels_**.                       | Linear Contrast:<br>- Tests if A > B > C follows a **_straight-line_** (increase or decrease)<br><br>Quadratic Contrast:<br>- Tests if values follow a **_U-shaped_** or **_inverted U-shaped_** pattern.<br><br>Cubic Contrast:<br>- Tests for **_more complex trends_**. |
| **_Advantages_**      | - Simple to interpret<br>- Works well when a **_specific group is at a logical baseline_** (e.g., placebo, pre-test, control group, etc.)                                                | - Useful for detecting **_gradual progressions_**<br>- More sensitive to stepwise changes than ANOVA tests                                                        | - Can **_identify trends_** across multiple levels rather than just comparing individual groups.<br>- Use for dose-response studies, behavioral trends, etc.                                                                                                               |
| **_Disadvantages_**   | - **_Does not show trends_** across levels (only compares each level to one reference).<br>- **_May miss patterns_** in the data **_if groups differ_** in more complex ways.            | - Ignores non-adjacent comparisons (e.g., A vs. C or A vs. D).<br><br>- Not useful if differences between levels **_are not sequential_**.                        | - Harder to interpret than simple or repeated contrasts.<br>- May require quadratic/cubic/etc. terms to capture complex patterns.                                                                                                                                          |
| **_Best Use_**        | - When comparing a treatment group to a control.<br>- When one condition serves as a logical starting or reference point.                                                                | - When assessing **_progressive changes over time_** (e.g., pre-, mid-, and post-test).<br>- When measuring stages of learning, recovery, treatment effects, etc. | - When analyzing dose-response relationships.<br>- When studying learning curves, reaction times, growth patterns, etc.<br>- When expecting non-linear trends in the data.                                                                                                 |
| **_Output_**          | Provides _p_-values and confidence intervals for each **_group_** vs. **_reference_** comparison.                                                                                        | Provides _p_-values and confidence intervals for **_each stepwise change_** between levels.                                                                       | Provides _p_-values for each trend component (linear, quadratic, cubic, etc.) to determine which best fits the data.                                                                                                                                                       |
